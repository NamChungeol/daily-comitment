R^2

sklearn‘s linear_model.LinearRegression comes with a .score() method that returns the coefficient 
of determination R² of the prediction.


예시:

# split data
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, train_size = 0.8, test_size = 0.2, random_state=6)

# pull the algorithm
mlr = LinearRegression()

# fit the model(train with inpendents variable)
model=mlr.fit(x_train, y_train)

# predict dependents variable of test set
y_predict = mlr.predict(x_test)

# R^2
print("Train score:")
print(mlr.score(x_train, y_train))

print("Test score:")
print(mlr.score(x_test, y_test))
